# Kallisto_transcriptomics
This is a guide how to do basic transcriptomic (RNA seq) analysis from bacterial monoculture. This is ment as a guide for researchers at The Center for Microbial Secondary Metabolites (CeMiSt) - https://cemist.dtu.dk/.   

## Setting up the environment in linux

First you would need to install MiniConda. 
Go to https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers 

Find the newest version with 64-bit. Right-click and copy the hyperlink.

In terminal, download the file: 
```bash
wget LINK
```
Example: 
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_22.11.1-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Now run the bash file: 

```bash
./ Miniconda*.sh
```

Install Mamba using Miniconda:
```bash
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```
This is used to create an environment to work in. 

Create an environment for Kallisto analysis:
```bash
mamba create --name kallisto
```
Activate the Kallisto environment: 
```bash
mamba activate kallisto 
```
